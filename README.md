# human-music
This is the symbiosis between the past, the present and the future

Human Music is a project that starts with the dream of a better future. I experience joy through the listening of music that I have never heard before, and I experience joy living experiences that remind me about the random nature of our existence as humans. Since the internet is a environment governed by algorythms that seek the maximization of profits of the owners of the different platforms, I decided to create a platform that generates music recommendations through which I think is one of the ultimately random algorythms in the world: Human Nature.


This place is for sharing from the heart. Each one of us has the opportunity for sharing something that you think will be valuable for whoever listens. Something that becomes a space of light within the darkness. Something that can help anyone that listens overcome anger, sadness or pain. Something that can help anyone that listens to foster happiness, gratitude or confort. Something that can help anyone that listens to go deeply inside of (him/her)self, and through that process fight (his/her) demons and become a better actor for our society in this crazy experience that we are all sharing called life. Something that can help whoever listens feel that (he/she) is not alone, for all what is needed is contained within.


There is no limitations, there is no boundaries, there is nothing that is good, there is nothing that is bad. What will make this place special is that your recommendation comes from your heart. I believe music is a string that unites us all, and through the understanding of this basic fact we can reach to a conception that on the source we are all part of the same family. We are all human. We are all in this together, no matter from where we come from, no matter our color of skin, money in the bank, no matter if you are sad, no matter if you are angry. We are all in this together, and if we recongnize this basic fact we can move forward for building a better world.
